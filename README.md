# SpesApp
SpesApp is __a grocery list app designed to help you avoid wasting food (and money!)__.

SpesApp automates the bookkeeping of two separate lists, one for items yet to buy and one for items to be bought: while at the store, you can check what you already have and avoid buying anything equivalent.

A single click allows you to move ticked grocery list items to storage and delete ticked storage.items.

## Features we are working on _right now_
- optionally assign an __expiration date__ and a user-defined __category__ to items
- sort items you bought by expiration date, so you don't forget about them
- highlight expired items
- group items to buy by category (e.g. by place where you buy them)

## Feature we will be working on _relatively soon_
- __cookbook__:
  - collect your recipes in a simple cookbook
  - see what you can cook with what you already have based on the recipes in you cookbook with a single click
  - select meals you want to prepare and automatically add the missing ingredient to the shopping list
- share grocery list via your favorite messaging app when you don't feel like going to the supermarket ;)
